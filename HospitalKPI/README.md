## Massachusetts General Hospital - Performance Metrics & KPI

### Project Background
Hospital management depends on the ability to quickly assess performance and identify the areas for improvement. However, the performance indicators are usually dispersed across multiple reports, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view. To address this issue, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) requested the development of a high-level KPI report that consolidates essential metrics in one single, accessible view. The dashboard enables the executive team to visualize key metrics such as length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, treament cost across age groups, payer distribution and common diagnosis, providing actionable insights to drive decision-making.

### Executive Summary
The analysis utilized over 28,000 [synthetic healthcare records](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/hospital-patient-records) representing more than 1,000 patients from Jan 01, 2011 to Feb 05, 2022. Throughout the period analyzed, the hospital maintained an average length of stay below 3-day, but the readmission rate remains above 20%, reaching a peak of 66% in 2019. This trend highlights a trade-off between efficient use of hospital beds and the increased need for follow-up care. Patients aged 18-44 consistently contributed the most to the average treatment cost over time. Medicare and private insurance accounted for the largest shares of the payers mix, which medical stays comprising the majority of admission for both payer groups. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, chronic conditions such as cancer and heart failure were the primary drivers of high treatment cost. Following onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Covid-19 treatment became the highest-cost category.
