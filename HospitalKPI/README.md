## Massachusetts General Hospital - Performance Metrics & KPI

### Project Background
Hospital management depends on the ability to quickly assess performance and identify the areas for improvement. However, the performance indicators are usually dispersed across multiple reports, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view. To address this issue, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) requested the development of a high-level KPI report that consolidates essential metrics in one single, accessible view. The dashboard enables the executive team to visualize key metrics such as length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, treament cost across age groups, payer distribution and common diagnosis, providing actionable insights to drive decision-making.

### Executive Summary
The analysis utilized the 28K+ [synthetic healthcare records](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/hospital-patient-records) of more than 1,000 patients from Jan 01, 2011 to Feb 05, 2022. The hospital keeps the average length of stay under 3-day, but the readmission rate remains over 20%, in which in 2019 the number reaches 66%, highest rate all time, indicating the trade-off between efficient use of hospital beds and high follow-up care. Group 18-44 is the most contributors to the average cost of treatment all time. While Medicare and Private Insurance are main players in payers mix and most of type of stays is Medical for both payers. Chronic disease (cancer, heart failure, ..) are high cost treatment until pandemic hit that make Covid-19 treamtment is the highest cost of treatment.
